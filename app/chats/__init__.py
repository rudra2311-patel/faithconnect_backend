"""
Chats module for FaithConnect.

Enables private messaging between worshipers and leaders.
Supports thoughtful, asynchronous spiritual guidance through text.

Real-world use case:
Worshipers can have private conversations with their spiritual leaders
for guidance, questions, or support. Leaders can respond when they have
time to provide thoughtful answers.

This is NOT real-time chat - it's designed for meaningful, considered
dialogue rather than instant messaging.
